# Overview
- gradually increase in size over time
- [Colloid Cyst Risk Score (CCRS) was proposed (c.2016) prognostic predictor](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/missing?article%5Btitle%5D=colloid-cyst-risk-score-ccrs&lang=us)
- Their position in the roof of the third ventricle immediately adjacent to the foramina of Monro can on occasion result in sudden obstructive hydrocephalus and can present with a thunderclap headache or unconscious collapse. The headaches tend to be positional, and patients may learn how to relieve symptoms.
# CT
>Typically seen as a well-defined, rounded lesion at the roof of the 3rd ventricle:
> - unilocular
> - typically hyperdense
> - isodense and hypodense cysts are uncommon
> - calcification is uncommon 2

> - no central enhancement, may have thin peripheral rim of enhancement which represents the cyst capsule
# MRI

> T1: variable
> - ~50% high signal 
> - the rest are hypointense or isointense to adjacent brain
> - T1 C+ (Gd): only rarely demonstrates thin rim enhancement, but usually this represents an enhancement of the adjacent and stretched septal veins 

> T2: variable
> - most are of low T2/T2* signal (short T2), related to thick "motor oil" consistency fluid 
> - some have central low T2 and high peripheral T2 signal
> - some are homogeneously high signal

> FLAIR: 
> - cysts which are of low signal on T2 will appear similar to attenuated CSF on FLAIR, and are thus difficult to appreciate 4
